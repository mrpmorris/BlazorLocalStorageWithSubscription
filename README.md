# BlazorLocalStorageWithSubscription
Demo BlazorLocalStorageWithSubscription

Quick demo showing how to read/write local storage, and subscribe to receive notifications.

You only get notifications from JS if a different tab performs the update, not your own. This library will send you a notification when your own tab makes the change, but only if you make the change using this library.
